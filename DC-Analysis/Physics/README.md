# Physics of Conductors and Insulators
This directory is dedicated to the physics of conductors and insulators.  While Jerzy Rutkowski's book does not cover such a topic, it does tie into circuit theory, and atleast [one textbook](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-12/introduction-conductance-and-conductors/) dedicates an entire chapter to it under DC-Analysis.
