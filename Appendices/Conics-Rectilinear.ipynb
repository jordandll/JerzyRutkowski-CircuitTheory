    "First, suppose that the focus $F$, directrix $L$, and every conic found in the above figure rests on a vector plane whose point of origin is at $F'$, the point of incidence between $L$ and the perpendicular dropped from $F$ to the directrix.  The unit vector $\\mathbf{i}$ rests on $L$ and the unit vector $\\mathbf{j}$ points towards the focus.  The terminal point of the variable vector $\\mathbf{P}$ tracks -- one may think of this as plotting -- the conic in question;  In the case of the figure found above, $P$ tracks the hyperbola."
